If you want to be able to use conda in PowerShell, you need to add the conda scripts to your path. You can do this by running the following command in PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:Path += ";C:\Users\USERNAME\Anaconda3\Scripts"
```

Next, you want to run _Anaconda Prompt_ as administrator. You can do this by right-clicking on the _Anaconda Prompt_ icon and selecting "Run as administrator".

Execute the following command in _Anaconda Prompt_ to register conda with PowerShell:

```powershell
conda init powershell
```

## Activate Conda in PowerShell

To activate conda, you can run the following command in PowerShell:

```powershell
conda activate
```

## Deactivate Conda in PowerShell

To deactivate conda, you can run the following command in PowerShell:

```powershell
conda deactivate
```

## To Stop Conda From Starting in PowerShell by default

If you want to stop conda starting in PowerShell by default, you can run the following command in _Anaconda Prompt_:

```powershell
conda config --set auto_activate_base false
```

## Create a New Conda Environment
to create a new conda environment, you can run:

```powershell
conda create --name myenv
```

## Displaying an Active Conda Environment in PowerShell Prompt Using Oh My Posh

If you want to display the active conda environment in PowerShell Prompt, you can use Oh My Posh. 

Once installed, you can modify your `*.omp.json file` to add the following bit to your prompt. Please note that this works for the _marcduiker_ theme I am using. You may need to modify it for your theme of choice:
