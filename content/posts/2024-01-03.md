I am using a Windows laptop for work. It runs Windows 11. I found that, for some reason, there is no native hotkey to open Bluetooth settings. I use Bluetooth headphones quite frequently and I need to be able to connect to a paired headset quickly.

Luckily, I found a solution to this problem. I created a shortcut to open the Bluetooth settings using the **AutoHotkey** app. I then assigned a hotkey to the shortcut. I chose `Win+K`, which normally opens Cast options. Now I can switch between my headphones and speakers with a simple hotkey. Here is how I did it:

1. Download and install AutoHotkey app from [here](https://www.autohotkey.com/).
2. Create a new *ahk* script.
3. Add the following code to the script:

4. Save the script.

Enjoy!
