It's been a while since I last posted. I've been busy with work and life in general. 

I thought I'd refresh myself on how to use Hugo CLI. Here are some of the common commands that I would like to log for future reference:

## Hugo CLI Commands

### Check Hugo Version

```bash
hugo version
```

### Create a New Blog Post

```bash
hugo new posts/[file-name].md
```
